# 15.07-26.07

- First version of Enhanced CNN-LSTM Network in jupyter notebook withoiut attention mechanism and social-pooling. Measure FDE (final displacement error in kms) and Average Displacement Error in kms. Should get results lower 1km for 5 scenes. predicted average time in milliseconds is not important for now

# 26.07 - 09.08

- If previous point is done successfully start to add attention (easier) and compare results to the original paper. Scores should be lower 0.5 km. After that add social pooling. Choose multiple seeds to get comparable results.

- If results are much worser (5 km on avarage for diffrent seeds) need to rethink model architecture and go back to previous point. If possible improve previous model if not choose another paper to implement

# 09.08 - 23.08

- If results are comparable start to work on refactoring and make a script for prediction
