# Iakshibaev Timur Weekly report, 25.03.2024-29.03.2024

## Previous weeks

- Alpha version of dataset for LLM in pictures

### Conclusion

- Dataset is needed, as that distinguish openai products the most, maybe can experiment with GPT4 prompts for text2video from personal account
- Need to try QWwen, they claim that their LLM is superior to LLAMA2, available on huggingface
- Need to put more time to finish a paper for patent

## Current week

- Wrote an instruction on ssh connection to github, can be seen [here](https://github.com/TimuJ/Unilab/blob/97be0f96cf135db84bb502484ae06becce06376a/instuctions/github_ssh_instruction.md)
- Working on mathematical understatement of diffusion, including reading introduction to convex by Nesterov and Understanding diffusion model by Luo, solved some convex problems in playground [results here](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6600fd80172526994a2755bf)
- Still working on patent, work can be seen on [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6604dec582caf95eac275b92)

## Next week

# Highest priority
